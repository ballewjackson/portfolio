# Howdy!

These files are part of my work for the A&M Course MEEN 210: Geometrical Modeling for Mechanical Design. This is the intro to design course for mechanical engineering and it also covers solidworks. In this course, project groups are tasked to build devices for the elederly that satisfy a number of requirements. My group decided to develop a Mandala art kit. Mandala art is a form of sand art practiced by Budhist Monks. Our kit was sort of a spin on water color kits that you get as a kid. My part of the project was the Chak-Pur funnel and the funnel folder files show my iterative design process over the course of project. Different geometries were tested for their performance and a simple two angle funnel was found to work best. Our approach was not necessarilly traditional. Chak-Pur funnels are typically rolled sheet metal. We could have chose this fabrication method but our goals in the course where to practice computer aided design and so printing the funnel was more inline with this.
